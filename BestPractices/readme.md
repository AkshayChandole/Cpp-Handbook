# [**7. Best Practices**](#7-best-practices)

Best practices are crucial for writing clean, maintainable, and error-free code. In C++, this involves adhering to principles that ensure your code is efficient, readable, and reliable. The following sections cover **clean code**, **error handling**, and **debugging techniques**, all of which play a significant role in developing robust C++ applications.

## [**7.1 Clean Code**](#71-clean-code)

Clean code is about writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It is written with the intention of minimizing complexity and maximizing clarity. A few key principles of clean code include:

1. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive variable, function, and class names that convey their purpose clearly.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     // Avoid
     int a, b, c;

     // Use
     int temperature, humidity, windSpeed;
     ```

2. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each function or class should have one responsibility and do it well. Avoid functions or classes that do too much.

3. **Keep Functions Small**: Functions should be small and do only one thing. If a function is too long or does too many things, refactor it into smaller, more focused functions.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     void processOrder() {
         validateOrder();
         calculateTotal();
         processPayment();
     }
     ```

4. **Consistent Formatting**: Consistently format your code to improve readability. This includes consistent indentation, spacing, and alignment.

5. **Avoid Magic Numbers**: Replace hard-coded values with named constants or enumerations to provide clarity.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     // Avoid
     double area = radius * 3.14;

     // Use
     const double PI = 3.14159;
     double area = radius * PI;
     ```

6. **Commenting and Documentation**: While clean code should be self-explanatory, use comments to explain "why" something is done, not "what" is done. The code itself should be the "what."
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     // Calculate the total price after applying tax.
     double totalPrice = price * (1 + taxRate);
     ```

## [**7.2 Error Handling**](#72-error-handling)

Error handling is about gracefully managing runtime errors to avoid crashes and undefined behavior. C++ provides a variety of error-handling mechanisms, and selecting the right one ensures reliability.

### [**7.2.1 Exception Handling**](#721-exception-handling)

**Exceptions** are used to handle runtime errors, such as invalid user input or system failures. C++ provides `try`, `catch`, and `throw` blocks to handle exceptions.

- **Throwing Exceptions:**
  When an error condition is detected, we can throw an exception using `throw`.
  ```cpp
  throw std::runtime_error("Something went wrong");
  ```

- **Catching Exceptions:**
  `catch` blocks are used to handle specific types of exceptions. You can catch different exception types or catch a generic `std::exception` base class.
  ```cpp
  try {
      // Code that may throw an exception
      throw std::out_of_range("Index is out of range");
  } catch (const std::out_of_range& e) {
      std::cout << "Caught exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
  } catch (const std::exception& e) {
      std::cout << "Generic exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
  }
  ```

- **Exception Safety:**
  - **Basic Guarantee:** If an exception occurs, the program will remain in a valid state.
  - **Strong Guarantee:** If an exception occurs, the program will leave the system in the same state as before the operation was initiated.

- **Best Practices for Exception Handling:**
  - Use exceptions for exceptional situations, not for normal control flow.
  - Always catch by reference (`catch (const std::exception& e)`).
  - Avoid catching all exceptions with a generic catch (`catch(...)`), as it can hide bugs.

### [**7.2.2 Using `std::optional` and `std::variant`**](#722-using-stdoptional-and-stdvariant)

C++11 introduced `std::optional` and `std::variant` as safer alternatives for handling error conditions without relying on exceptions.

**1. `std::optional`:**
   - `std::optional` is used to represent a value that might be absent. It is a type that may or may not contain a value.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     #include <optional>
     #include <iostream>

     std::optional<int> findValue(bool success) {
         if (success) {
             return 42;  // Value found
         } else {
             return std::nullopt;  // No value
         }
     }

     int main() {
         auto result = findValue(true);
         if (result) {
             std::cout << "Found value: " << *result << std::endl;
         } else {
             std::cout << "No value found" << std::endl;
         }
         return 0;
     }
     ```
   - **Advantages**: Prevents null pointer dereferencing, and provides a clear way to indicate missing values without exceptions.

**2. `std::variant`:**
   - `std::variant` is a type-safe union, where a variable can hold one of several types but only one at a time.
   - **Example:**
     ```cpp
     #include <variant>
     #include <iostream>

     using VarType = std::variant<int, std::string>;

     void printValue(const VarType& v) {
         if (std::holds_alternative<int>(v)) {
             std::cout << "Integer: " << std::get<int>(v) << std::endl;
         } else {
             std::cout << "String: " << std::get<std::string>(v) << std::endl;
         }
     }

     int main() {
         VarType v1 = 42;
         VarType v2 = "Hello";

         printValue(v1);
         printValue(v2);

         return 0;
     }
     ```
   - **Advantages**: Safe handling of different types, which avoids undefined behavior from traditional unions.

## [**7.3 Debugging Techniques**](#73-debugging-techniques)

Debugging is a critical skill that allows developers to find and fix issues in their code. Below are some techniques and tools that can help make the debugging process more efficient:

### [**1. Using a Debugger (GDB/LLDB)**](#1-using-a-debugger-gdblldb)

A debugger is a tool that helps trace the execution of a program and inspect its state at various points.

- **Setting Breakpoints:**
  You can set breakpoints at specific lines to pause execution and examine the program's state.
  ```bash
  gdb ./my_program
  (gdb) break main.cpp:10  # Set breakpoint at line 10 of main.cpp
  ```

- **Stepping Through Code:**
  You can step through the code line-by-line to observe variable values and execution flow.
  ```bash
  (gdb) step   # Step into function calls
  (gdb) next   # Step over function calls
  ```

- **Inspecting Variables:**
  You can inspect variable values during execution.
  ```bash
  (gdb) print myVar
  ```

### [**2. Logging**}(#2-logging)

Logging is useful for tracking the flow of execution and capturing runtime information. Use logging libraries like `spdlog` or `log4cpp`, or simple `std::cout` statements in C++.

- **Example:**
  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>

  void processOrder(int orderId) {
      std::cout << "Processing order " << orderId << std::endl;
  }
  ```

- **Best Practices:**
  - Log important function calls, variables, and error messages.
  - Use different log levels (info, debug, error) for various types of logs.
  - Avoid excessive logging, especially in production code.

### [**3. Static Analysis Tools**](#3-static-analysis-tools)

Static analysis tools analyze code for potential errors without running it. Tools like `clang-tidy`, `cppcheck`, and `SonarQube` can help identify bugs, memory leaks, and other issues early in the development process.

- **Example (clang-tidy):**
  ```bash
  clang-tidy my_file.cpp --checks=clang-analyzer-*
  ```

### [**4. Unit Testing**](#4-unit-testing)

Unit testing involves writing tests for individual functions or components. Frameworks like Google Test (`gtest`) provide a way to automate the testing process, which can help catch bugs early.

- **Example (Google Test):**
  ```cpp
  #include <gtest/gtest.h>

  int add(int a, int b) {
      return a + b;
  }

  TEST(AddTest, Positive) {
      EXPECT_EQ(add(1, 2), 3);
  }

  int main(int argc, char** argv) {
      ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
      return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
  }
  ```

### [**5. Code Reviews**](#5-code-reviews)

Peer code reviews are essential for identifying bugs and improving code quality. Having others review your code can help spot mistakes you may have missed and lead to better solutions.

## [**Conclusion**](#conclusion)

Following best practices for clean code, error handling, and debugging not only helps in writing maintainable and efficient C++ code but also leads to fewer bugs, easier collaboration, and faster development cycles. Debugging techniques like using a debugger, logging, and static analysis are invaluable tools in identifying and fixing problems in your applications.
